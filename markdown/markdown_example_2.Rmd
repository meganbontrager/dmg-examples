## This is a markdown document

If you want this to render on github, you need to add the keep_md option as I have above. Some things still won't look as nice on the github site as they do in the html you create locally.

You can have a nice, linked table of contents with the toc options.

### You can run code right in here

If echo = TRUE, the code is displayed. For a more polished doc, set echo to FALSE.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
dat = read_csv("../data/clean_vern.csv")
```

### You can build plots too

With code:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = site, y = height_cm, fill = site)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Population", y = "Height (cm)")
```

Or with a relative path (might not work with pdfs?):

![](../plots/height_pop.png)

### You can also make simple tables

##### Either with code:

```{r, echo =  TRUE}
kable(dat %>% group_by(site, block) %>% summarize(n = n()))
```

##### Or by typing them in:

Variable | Definition
---------|----------------------
stem_diam_mm | Stem diameter in millimeters
longest_leaf_mm | Length of the longest leaf, not including petiole, in millimeters
height_cm | Height to tallest part of plant, in centimeters
number_true_leaves | The number of true leaves on a plant


### You can also call to R in line

For example, the populations in this dataset are `r unique(dat$site)`.


### Math is not too bad

$\pi r^2$


### Interactive graphs?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# selectInput("measurement", "measurement", c("height_cm", "stem_diam_mm", "longest_leaf_mm", "number_true_leaves"))

# renderPlot({
#   ggplot(dat) +
#   geom_boxplot(aes_string(x = "site", y = input$measurement, fill = "site")) +
#   guides(fill = FALSE) +
#   labs(x = "Population")
# })
```
